"""One line gates every tool an agent calls — no per-tool code, no parameters.

``shield.agentic.guard()`` returns a native LangChain callback handler. LangChain
fires it before each tool runs; the PDP decides ALLOW / DENY / REQUIRE_APPROVAL,
and a block aborts the tool. The tool name comes from the framework and the
tier / policy / identity are all resolved server-side — the application only
attaches the handler.
