"""Gate any function as a tool. The gateway PDP decides before the body runs:
ALLOW runs it, MASK redacts PII kwargs, REQUIRE_APPROVAL blocks for a human,
DENY raises. Only the VK + base_url are configured — identity, policy and the
tool's tier (recovery cost / sensitivity) are resolved server-side from the
Tools & Tiering registry, so the only thing you pass is the tool name.

Prefer ``shield.agentic.guard()`` (see guard.py) for whole agents — this
decorator is the explicit, per-function form."""
