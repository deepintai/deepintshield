"""Agent identity credential implementations.

A credential is anything that can produce an agent identity token to present
alongside the platform VK on every PEP request. The right implementation is
auto-selected by :class:`AgenticEngine` based on the ``provider_type`` it
discovers from the gateway — developers almost never instantiate these
directly.
