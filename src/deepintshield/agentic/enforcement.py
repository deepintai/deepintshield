"""Non-bypassable enforcement installer for every supported framework.

The per-framework adapters gate tools *when the developer calls* ``govern()`` /
``guard()``. That still leaves a gap: nothing stops code from skipping that call
and running the agent directly. ``install_all`` closes it by monkey-patching each
framework's build/execute boundary the moment a DeepintShield client is created,
so a tool/graph can't run ungoverned — the developer no longer has to remember.

Design rules every framework installer follows:
  * **Lazy engine** — takes a ``get_engine`` callable resolved on first use, so
    installing at client construction never forces the agentic surface to build.
  * **Only if imported** — we patch a framework only when it's already in
    ``sys.modules`` (never force-import a dep the user isn't using).
  * **Idempotent** — re-installing re-binds the provider, never double-wraps.
  * **Fail-open on infra, fail-CLOSED on a verdict** — a gateway hiccup must not
    break the app, but a DENY must still block. Each installer swallows
    infrastructure errors and re-raises ``GuardrailDenied`` / approval timeouts.

Cooperative defense-in-depth: a determined process can un-patch these or call a
tool's raw function object, so the gateway (MCP/LLM in the call path) stays the
authoritative boundary. For ordinary application code this makes enforcement the
default rather than something to remember.
