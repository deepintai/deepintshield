"""Agentic-layer exception hierarchy.

Each PDP verdict maps to a distinct exception so the caller can pattern-
match the kind of failure without inspecting strings. Audit metadata
(decision_id, policy_id, reason, obligations) is preserved on the exception
so the caller can log it without re-fetching from the audit endpoint.

All agentic errors subclass the unified ``DeepintShieldError`` so a single
``except DeepintShieldError`` catches both LLM-stage guardrail failures and
PDP rejections.
