"""The single decision-and-enforce core that every framework adapter and
the ``@shield.agentic.tool`` decorator funnel through.

Contract:
    * Build a DelegationContext from the args, compute the SHA-256 digest of
      the canonicalised args, and call ``engine.decide()``.
    * On ALLOW: return the (unchanged) kwargs.
    * On MASK: apply obligations to the kwargs and return them.
    * On REQUIRE_APPROVAL: poll the approval endpoint; continue on approval,
      raise on denial/timeout.
    * On DENY: raise ``GuardrailDenied`` — the body must not run.
