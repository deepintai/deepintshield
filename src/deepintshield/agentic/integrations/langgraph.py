"""LangGraph enforcement — gate every node in a compiled graph through the PDP.

Drop-in: no per-tool decorator, no graph-shape change. Mutates the graph in
place and returns it so existing ``invoke()`` code is unchanged. The node name
is the governed tool name the PDP checks.

Interception is done at the node's underlying callable. In current LangGraph a
compiled node is a ``PregelNode`` whose ``.bound`` is a ``RunnableCallable``
holding the user function in ``.func`` / ``.afunc`` — wrapping those intercepts
every invocation regardless of how the Pregel loop dispatches it (the older
approach of wrapping ``runnable.invoke`` silently missed plain function nodes,
because ``PregelNode.runnable`` is ``None``). We wrap ``func``/``afunc`` first
and fall back to ``invoke``/``ainvoke`` for ToolNodes / custom runnables.
