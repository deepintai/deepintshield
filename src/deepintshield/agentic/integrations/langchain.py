"""LangChain / LangGraph enforcement via the framework's NATIVE callback system.

This is the thinnest possible integration. LangChain already dispatches an
``on_tool_start`` event to every registered callback handler *before* any tool
runs — a LangChain ``BaseTool``, a ``@tool`` function, a LangGraph ``ToolNode``
or a prebuilt ReAct agent's tools. We supply a single ``BaseCallbackHandler``
that calls the PDP in that hook and aborts the tool when the verdict blocks. The
framework does all of the tool discovery, argument parsing and dispatch; the
vendor code here is one small class.

The application attaches it once and never touches individual tools::

    shield = DeepintShield.from_env()
    agent.invoke({"input": "…"}, config={"callbacks": [shield.agentic.guard()]})

No per-tool decorator, no wrapping, and no parameters: the tool name comes from
LangChain and every policy / tier / identity input is resolved server-side.

Note on MASK: a callback cannot rewrite a tool's arguments, so arg-level masking
isn't applied on this path (the MASK decision is still recorded server-side and
the call proceeds). Use ``shield.agentic.tool`` / a per-framework adapter when
you need the SDK to redact arguments locally before the body runs.
