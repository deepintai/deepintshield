    The returned client includes an httpx event hook that adds a stable
    ``prompt_cache_key`` to outbound chat completion requests so OpenAI's
    automatic prompt cache partitions cleanly per logical prefix. Caching
    itself is governed by the workspace-level Provider Prompt Caching switch
    on the gateway — if the workspace has it disabled the gateway strips the
    key before forwarding.

    Callers passing their own ``http_client`` are respected (no hook is
    attached); they're assumed to manage caching themselves.
